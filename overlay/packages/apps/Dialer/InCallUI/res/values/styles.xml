<!-- Theme for the InCallActivity activity. Should have a transparent background for the
         circular reveal animation for a new outgoing call to work correctly. We don't just use
         Theme.Black.NoTitleBar directly, since we want any popups or dialogs from the
         InCallActivity to have the correct Material style. -->
